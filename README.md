# TalkToWhiz.io
A repository for NLP, Time Series and Sequential Data problems <br>
In this repository I have added the projects (python codes) I implemented on Time Series or Sequential Data.  <br>
Three out of four files are the python codes that make use of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Model), GRU (Gated Recuurent Unit) and VGG16 converted from 2D to 1D.  <br>
The code for VGG16 for 1D data is also attached in the repository.  <br>
Happy Learning Peeps! :)
